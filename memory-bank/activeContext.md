# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The portfolio project is currently in the initial setup phase. The basic Next.js application has been created with TailwindCSS integration. The following areas are the current focus:

1. Completing the foundational layout structure
2. Implementing the main responsive navigation
3. Developing the hero section with animations
4. Setting up the project showcase section

## Recent Changes
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript
- Set up TailwindCSS with custom configuration
- Integrated shadcn/ui components
- Added Framer Motion for animations
- Configured basic project structure

## Next Steps
1. **Layout & Navigation**:
   - Create responsive navbar component
   - Implement mobile menu with animations
   - Set up main layout with proper responsive behavior

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Design and implement hero section with animated elements
   - Create custom typography components
   - Add scroll indicator and smooth scroll functionality

3. **Projects Section**:
   - Create project card components
   - Implement grid/masonry layout for projects
   - Add filtering/categorization capability

4. **Skills Visualization**:
   - Design interactive skills display
   - Implement animations for skills visualization
   - Ensure responsive behavior across devices

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design System
- Finalizing color palette and typography system
- Deciding on animation complexity vs. performance
- Determining the level of interactivity for project cards

### Technical Decisions
- Whether to implement server components for data fetching
- How to structure project data (JSON, MDX, or CMS)
- Animation library usage patterns for consistent effects

### UX Considerations
- Navigation flow between sections
- Balance between visual appeal and performance
- Accessibility considerations for interactive elements

## Open Questions
- Should projects be loaded dynamically or statically?
- What filtering/sorting options should be available for projects?
- How detailed should the skills visualization be?
- Should contact form use server actions or client-side submission?

## Chatbot Integration

A chatbot feature has been added to the portfolio to enhance visitor interaction. The chatbot uses the OpenRouter API with the Deepseek model to provide responses about the portfolio owner's skills, projects, and experience.

### Implementation Details

- **Architecture**: Client-side implementation using Next.js and React Context API
- **API Integration**: OpenRouter API with environment variable configuration
- **UI Components**: Floating chat button, expandable chat window, message list, and input components
- **Persistence**: Chat history saved in local storage for session continuity
- **Styling**: Matches the portfolio's existing design language using Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading indicators using Framer Motion
- **Context**: Portfolio information provided as system prompt for contextual responses

### Current Focus

- Ensuring the chatbot provides accurate and helpful responses
- Testing the chat interface on various devices and screen sizes
- Security considerations for API key handling
- Fine-tuning the portfolio context for better response quality
